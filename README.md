Hi, I am James Ding.
- I was born in Toronto, but I grew up in Cleveland.
- I am enrolled at the University of Waterloo for Honors Computer Engineering.
- I have strong experience in app development with Java, C# with Unity, and Python.
- I have also used Javascript, TypeScript, and React Native for smaller projects.

The project I am current most invested in right now is Concert Maestro:
https://github.com/james-ding-loves-igloos/rhythm-learning-app
- It is a mobile app that aims to teach musical rhythm counting at the high-school level.
- Users are shown a section of music notation and are meant to tap to the rhythm on their screens after a count-in.
- There are also tapping guides on certain levels, meant to help users that are stuck on a tricky rhythm.
