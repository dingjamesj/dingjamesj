Hi, I am James Ding.
- I was born in Toronto, but I grew up in Cleveland since the age of five.
- I am enrolled at the University of Waterloo for Honors Computer Engineering.
- I have experience in developing apps using Java, C#, Python, Javascript, TypeScript, React Native, and the Unity Engine.

The project I am current most invested in right now is Concert Maestro:
https://github.com/james-ding-loves-igloos/rhythm-learning-app
- It is a mobile app that aims to teach musical rhythm counting at the high-school level.
- Users are shown a section of music notation and are meant to tap to the rhythm on their screens after a count-in.
- There are also tapping guides on certain levels, meant to help users that are stuck on a tricky rhythm.
